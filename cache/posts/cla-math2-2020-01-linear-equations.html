<h1>Linear equations</h1>
<p>Last class we started with something that lead us to a linear equation.
Sometimes, equations has only (and only one) solution.</p>
<p>Equations like $4x+2=19$ has only one solution, which we can derive doing our basic algebra steps.</p>
<p>But, something like this</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
3x+2y=9
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>has two unknowns and, therefore, we can't solve for both at once ..let's say I want to solve for $x$</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
3x=9-2y
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
x=3-\frac{2}{3}y
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>If I want to solve for $y$ I end up with:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{3}{2} x+\frac{9}{2}=y
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>that is the same thing but written in a different way .. but .. no unique answer could be obtained from that.</p>
<p>Let's look at the begining $3x=9-2y$</p>
<p>let's say I force $x$ to be 1 ...</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
3\cdot 1=9-2y
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>now, there is only one unknown and it's possible to solve for $y$ ... what this tells us?
There are infinite solutions for this kind of equations.</p>
<p>Not a very surprising thig, but, what if I decide to plot those &quot;infiinte&quot;
results whatever $x$ I chose, paired with the y that matches the equation?</p>
<p>Well... we get a line. Not very clever that <em>linear equations</em> has a <em>line</em> as a plot
for its answers, but it's an easy way to remember them.</p>
