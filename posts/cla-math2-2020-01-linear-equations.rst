****************
Linear equations
****************

Last class we started with something that lead us to a linear equation. 
Sometimes, equations has only (and only one) solution.

Equations like $4x+2=19$ has only one solution, which we can derive doing our basic algebra steps.

But, something like this 

.. math::
	
	3x+2y=9 

has two unknowns and, therefore, we can't solve for both at once ..let's say I want to solve for $x$

.. math::
	
	3x=9-2y 
.. math::

	x=3-\frac{2}{3}y

If I want to solve for $y$ I end up with:

.. math::
	
	\frac{3}{2} x+\frac{9}{2}=y	
	


that is the same thing but written in a different way .. but .. no unique answer could be obtained from that.

Let's look at the begining $3x=9-2y$ 

let's say I force $x$ to be 1 ... 

.. math::

	3\cdot 1=9-2y 

now, there is only one unknown and it's possible to solve for $y$ ... what this tells us? 
There are infinite solutions for this kind of equations.

Not a very surprising thig, but, what if I decide to plot those "infiinte" 
results whatever $x$ I chose, paired with the y that matches the equation?

Well... we get a line. Not very clever that *linear equations* has a *line* as a plot 
for its answers, but it's an easy way to remember them.

Excercises
==========

Let's practice:

Make a plot with a chart of values
----------------------------------

1. :math:`x+2=y`
2. :math:`2x+2=y`
3. :math:`\frac{1}{2}x+2=y`
4. :math:`6x-1=y`
5. :math:`3x=y`

Find $y$ value given $x$ value
------------------------------

1. :math:`y=2x-3 \qquad x=0`
2. :math:`y=2x-3 \qquad x=2`
3. :math:`y=x+3 \qquad x=1`
4. :math:`y=-2x+1 \qquad x=3`
5. :math:`y=\frac{3}{4}x-3 \qquad x=4`
