Manipulating line equations
***************************

Review
======

Last class topic was about how linear equations solutions can be thought as
all points that creates a line. Whe have something like this:

.. math::
 	
 	y=3\cdot x +2

or

.. math::
 	
 	2y+x=3

And we can choose wathever value we like for one variable, and the other gets fixed and
related. There is one $y$ value for each $x$ value, and vice-veresa, buth this pairs 
are unique.

Getting the line
================


.. admonition:: Learning goals

	1. Write a line equation solving for a variable
	2. Write a line equation given its slope and intercept
	3. Plot points and lines in a cartesian coordinate system


If we plot linear equations solutions, we'll get lines. That's easy. But how can one
identify which equation formed a given line?

Slope

Play with $a$ value ¿what changes in the plot?


Intercept
---------

Now, we fixed $a$ (the number in front of $x$), and let $b$ take different values ¿What does $b$ changes in the plot?

Come together
-------------

Now if we add both ideas, that $a$ it's about plot tilting (it points upwwards or dowwards) and $b$ stands for 
the $y$ value where the **line** intercepts the $y$ axis, namely, if $x=0$ then $y=b$. Any linear equation can be
writen as:

.. math::

	y=a \cdot x + b

There is nothing special about solving for y, it's just a convention of math people trhough history.
We call $y$ the vertical axis, and $x$$ the horizontal. But it's pretty usual to solve for $x$ 
or to use other letters, because they are just placeholders, letters, and have no special meaning.


Run and Rise
============

A way of telling which function (equation) belongs to a given plot it's to find $a$ and $b$. Fin $b$ it's straight
because one has to look at $y$ axis interception. But ¿what about $a$?. A method is as follows:

1. Step on a point that belongs to the line (a solution, an $x$,$y$ pair)
2. Run to the right (left will be ok too, you'll se later) any given units you want (1,2,3)
3. Write down this value. We call it :math:`\Delta x`
4. Rise (or go down) until you  reach the line again
5. Count the units that took you there
6. Write down this value. We call it :math:`\Delta y`
7. Do :math:`\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}`
8. Result is $a$

Test what you've leanred
========================

Finding parameters
------------------

1. Write a linear equation with $a=2$ and $b=-1$ .Plot it
2. What's $b$ value in :math:`y=\frac{2}{3}x+2` 
3. What's $a$ value in :math:`y=\frac{1}{3}x+2`
4. What's $b$ value in :math:`y+2=3x+1`
5. What's $a$ value in :math:`2y=\frac{2}{3}x+2`

From plot to equation
---------------------

Write the equation for each plot
